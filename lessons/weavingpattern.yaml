      ## Repeating Patterns
      When you weave cloth, you repeat the same over-under pattern many times.
      Computers do the same thing with **loops**.

      ## Step 1 – Make a Pattern
      Shake the phone 4 times quickly, then hold still for 2 seconds.
      Each shake is like one “repeat” in a weaving row.

      ## From Weaving to Code
      If you shake 4 times → that’s like:  
      **repeat 4 times:** weave one row  
      In code that would be a **loop** that runs 4 times.
      Loops let computers do boring, repeating work very fast.
