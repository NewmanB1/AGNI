      ## Plants Need Light
      Plants use light to make food — a process called photosynthesis.
      Your phone can measure light levels.
  - type: "hardware_trigger"
    sensor: "ambient_light"
    threshold: "light > 300lux"
    feedback: "vibration:short"

      ## Step 1 – Bright Light
      Point your phone toward a lamp or window.
      Wait for the vibration when the light level is high.
  - type: "hardware_trigger"
    sensor: "ambient_light"
    threshold: "light < 50lux"
    feedback: "vibration:long"

      ## Step 2 – Dark / Shadow
      Cover the sensor with your hand or go into a dark room.
      You should feel a longer vibration when it gets very dark.

      ## Plants in the Dark
      Plants grow best in bright light and struggle in the dark.
      That’s why they need sunlight — just like your phone noticed the difference!
