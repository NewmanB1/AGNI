      # The Force of Gravity
      
      Gravity is the force that pulls objects toward the center of the Earth. 
      
      In the next step, you will feel this force. **Hold your phone flat in your hand.**

      ## Did you feel that?
      
      When the phone fell, the internal accelerometer read **Zero-G**.
      
      This is because gravity was pulling the phone down at the exact same speed it was pulling the internal sensors.
