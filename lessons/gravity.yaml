      ## The Invisible Force
      Right now, gravity is pulling you — and everything around you — downward.
      Your phone can actually **feel** this force.

      ## Step 1 – Calibration
      Hold the phone perfectly flat (screen facing straight up, resting on
      your open palm or a table).
      Wait until you feel a short vibration.

      ## Step 2 – Freefall
      Now gently drop the phone from about 30–50 cm onto a soft surface
      (pillow, cushion, bed, etc.).
      When it feels weightless for a moment, you should feel a longer,
      rhythmic vibration.

      ## What just happened?
      **Flat on your hand** → the phone felt ~9.8 m/s² downward acceleration (normal gravity)
      **During the drop** → the phone felt almost 0 m/s² → this is **freefall**
      That feeling of weightlessness is exactly what astronauts experience!

      ## Quick check
      Why did the phone feel weightless when you dropped it?
    answer_options:
      - "The phone became lighter"
      - "Gravity suddenly stopped working"
      - "The phone was falling at the same speed as gravity pulls → no felt force"
      - "The battery ran out of power"
