      ## Acceleration During Freefall

      Look at this graph of acceleration:

      ![Acceleration Graph](assets/accel-graph.png)

      | Time (s) | Acceleration (m/s²) | Notes             |
      |----------|----------------------|-------------------|
      | 0.0      | 9.8                  | Normal gravity    |
      | 0.5      | 9.8                  | Still held        |
      | 1.0      | 0.2                  | In freefall       |
      | 1.5      | 0.1                  | Almost weightless |

      The relationship can be modeled as:

      $$     a(t) = g - k \cdot t     $$
