      ## Acceleration During Freefall
      Look at this graph of acceleration:

      ![Acceleration Graph](assets/accel-graph.svg)

      | Time (s) | Acceleration (m/s²) | Notes             |
      |----------|----------------------|-------------------|
      | 0.0      | 9.8                  | Normal gravity    |
      | 0.5      | 9.8                  | Still held        |
      | 1.0      | 0.2                  | In freefall       |
      | 1.5      | 0.1                  | Almost weightless |

      The relationship can be modeled as:

      $$a(t) = g - k \cdot t$$
    expected_duration: "PT2M"
    weight: 0.6

      ## Try It Yourself
      Drop the phone gently onto a soft surface and watch the acceleration drop to near zero.

      ## Well done! 🎉
      You have seen how acceleration changes during freefall.
      The graph matches what your phone just measured.
