      ## Your Phone Is a Protractor
      Hold your phone upright and slowly tilt it left and right.
      The screen will show you the angle you're creating.

      ## Step 1 – Find 45°
      Tilt your phone until you feel a short vibration.
      That means you've reached 45 degrees — a very important angle!

    sensor: "gyroscope"
    threshold: "gyro.beta >= 90"
    feedback: "vibration:long"

      ## Step 2 – Reach 90°
      Keep tilting until you feel a longer vibration.
      You've now reached a right angle — 90 degrees.

      ## What did you discover?
      Small tilts = small angles  
      Big tilts = big angles  
      90° is special — it's a **right angle** (used in squares, rectangles, and many buildings).
